## About

Host Monitor is a simple hosts monitoring service with notifications. Currently supports monitoring only through pinging and notifications through a telegram channel.

## Configuration

Configuration file has three parts. In the `watch` section, the monitoring targets, the type and interval of the scans, as well as notification templates for monitoring events are specified. The `sinks` section contains the destination points for unloading monitoring events. There is the **console** predefined sink that just redirects to stdout. Some sinks may required credentials that can be configured in `credentials` section.

In the notification templates available few variables.

`$now` - current time. Formatting affected by `locale` and `timeZone`

`$host` - `hostname` property

`$elapsed` - time elapsed from last changing host state

### Example

`config.json` should be in the mounted folder.

```json

  "locale": "en-US",
  "timeZone": "Europe/Kyiv",
  "credentials": {
    "myTgBot": {
      "type": "tg", // credentials type

    }
  },
  "sinks": {
    "someTgChannel": {

      "credentials": "myTgBot", // credentials previously defined above
      "channelId": -1001234567890
    }
  },
  "watch": [
